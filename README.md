This project is the result of numerous requests for the same additional feature to the [RPi Smart Still](https://github.com/larry-athey/rpi-smart-still) system. However, this would actually be a stand-alone device rather than a feature of that system.

Many people seem to think that it's possible for a computer to know what flavors they prefer _(or not)_ in their distillate. Sorry, AI can't even do that because it would require gas chromatography to determine what's in there at what concentrations, and that's anything but a quick process. Then the AI would need to be trained on what you like or dislike. Seriously, lay off the sci-fi movies, they're anything but based on reality.

No, Genio and iStill don't have this capability, either. The most they can do is pause the run so you can toss your heads/foreshots based on the volume and ABV of the wash in your boiler. What's more, it's just based on an approximation using simple math, there's honestly nothing high tech about it.

This device allows you to automate your cuts by automatically swapping out jars once they are filled about one inch from the top. These can be pint or quart size Mason jars placed on any diameter Lazy Susan turntable under your condenser outlet. You simply calibrate the controller to the distance between jars and their height.
