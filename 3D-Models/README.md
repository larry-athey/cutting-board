# 3D Model Notes

The model **CB-Flange-Gripper.stl** should be printed with TPU or other rubber-like filament so that it can be pressed tightly against the end of the lazy susan turntable and still allow the stepper motor to turn without too much resistance against it. You can stretch this model vertically in your slicing software to fit the edge of your turntable. The following turntable was used during the development of this project. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C65XVDGS
