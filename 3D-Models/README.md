# 3D Model Notes

No, I haven't put any effort into a fancy case here because this whole project is nothing but a prototype, it's pretty much just a 3D printed version of what Radio Shack used to sell. The front half of the [Airhead](https://github.com/larry-athey/airhead) case and buttons are used for the LilyGo T-Display S3 here. Install your Lilygo in the front half of the case and use four M3 bolts and nuts to mount it to the **CB-Case-Top.stl** model.

The model **CB-Flange-Gripper.stl** should be printed with TPU or other rubber-like filament so that it can be pressed tightly against the edge of the lazy susan turntable and still allow the stepper motor to turn without too much resistance against it. You can stretch this model vertically in your slicing software to fit the edge of your turntable. The following turntable was used during the development of this project. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C65XVDGS

A 22 mm flange from Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF46M4NH) was used here. I recommend attaching the gripper to the flange with silicone and allowing it to set up, then use 10 mm M2 self-tapping screws to lock it in place. This allows you to make sure that the gripper is centered on the flange before driving screws into it.
